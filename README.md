# Overview
This Project is a clone of the razorpay website's homepage/landing page. This was made to <b>practice <i>TAILWIND CSS</i> framework</b>.

# Technologies Used
1) HTML5
2) CSS3
3) Tailwind CSS

# Features
This is my first mega project which is made using the Tailwind CSS. I tried to make it as close as possible to the original website's homepage. Have made some changes in the color and size of the text here and there, and also have experimented with the transitions of certain elements like in the navbar and the buttons that are present on the homepage.

# Demo
You can view the live demo of the project <a href="https://razorpay-landing-page-clone.netlify.app" target="_blank">here</a>.

# My Learnings
<ul>
<li>I learned much about the Tailwind CSS and practiced it to get myself comfortable in using it, via this project.</li>
<li>Got to know how to handle responsive behaviour of the page in tailwind css using the predefined breakpoints like <b><i>md: , lg: , xl:</b></i> etc.</li>
<li>Also, got to know how to use the pre-defined components/classes like <b><i>grid, flex, border, w(for width), h(for height)</b></i> etc. in the Tailwind CSS that makes it so much easier to use than the basic CSS. Moreover, learned <b>how to give custom values in pre-defined components in tailwind css</b>.</li>
<li>Learned how to make a forever running animation on an image which makes it go like a moving banner (please check it out in the live demo).</li>
</ul>

My major learning while making this project was <b><i>how to refer to the documentation and read to get most of the issues resolved</b></i> on my way developing this project.
